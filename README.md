## Description

This week's challenge was about creating a a weather tracker. The application needed to display the current weather for an inputted city, along with the 5 day forcast and previous city inputs.

# Challenges

I had a few challenges while going through this challenge, these include using local storage with the previous cities and using the API correctly

## Using Local Storage

With the past few activities one of the main challenges that I face is using local storage. Even though I've been using it for a few weeks I still had trouble making it completely correctly.  However I still got a working part done while using the local storage.

This is an example of the Local Storage Inputs

## Using the API

This was my first activity using an API so it was tricky getting used to it.  However, after digging around a little bit and looking at previous activities I was able to figure it out. One main issue was that I was not able to get the UVI Data from the weather API, I was talking to my classmates and we believe that it was taken out and put in a premium version of the API.

# Conclusion

All in all this challenge really helped me with going out of my confort zone while using APIs. I'm very happy with how this turned out and I hope I continue to understand these amazing concepts!
